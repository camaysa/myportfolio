                Computer Techonology and Camaysa Crittenden
                </h3>
                <p>Hello, my name is Camaysa Crittenden. I was born August 3, 2000 in Grand Junction, Colorado. 	</p>
				 <p>I am currently a senior in high school and I have been in love with Computer technology all of my life. My mom has been a computer teacher all my life and I have always loved to watch her and was very fascinated by the things that she was capable of doing on the computer.</p>
				<p>This interest sparked me to want to embark on a journey to find out as much as I could when it came to computers. So as soon as I hit the 5th grade, when I was finally able to take a computer class, I joined my moms class. For the next 8 years, I enjoyed and learned more and more. I have taken so many computer classes that I have developed such great skills, people are often amazed at the abilities I have as such a young age.</p>
				<p>I like to use computers and I use them for just about everything. My favorite thing to do is to use programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create and play with images.</p>
