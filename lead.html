                <h4>FBLA and SheTech Leadership Conferences</h4>
                <p> In the past three years I have attended numerous leadership conferences. I attended our school district's yearly CTSO conference held at the Blanding Arts and Events Center. These events have included leadership events and great speakers like Larry Gelwix.
</p>
		<p>This year I also attended the 2017 FBLA Fall Leadership Conference that was held in Salt Lake City, UT. We also had the opportunity to have a great speaker and amazing leadership sessions that ranged from how to run for state office to discovering the leader within. I also had the chance to attend the annual SheTech conference this year and it was amazing to be surrounded by so many young women that shared my genuine interest in technology. I enjoyed attending sessions for cybersecurity, the techzone, as well as learning about tech companies like Qualtrics.

		    <h4>Community Garden Clean up</h4>
                <p>My favorite community service activity was during the summer after my junior year. I attended the ACT bootcamp that was held in Price, UT. This was a week long event that was organized to help students in preparing for the ACT. While there we had a great opportunity to help the community in Price, UT by working at a local community garden. The local garden was ran by elderly people who grew vegetables that were donated to people in need. As a group we went in and helped them to weed, plant, plow, water and more.</p>
		    <h4>SUN Center Service Project</h4>
		<p>In FBLA, we had a chance to participate in the SUN Center service project that allowed us to write christmas cards to both elderly people in nursing homes as well as veterans. It was an interesting experience because there was so much that I wanted to tell them, that I was thankful for them. </p>
		    <h4>Food Bank</h4>
		<p>One Wednesday a month, I went down and helped at the local food bank. One of the times I went, my job was to pick out oranges, potatoes, and tangerines and distrbute them into bags for people. We served over 50 people that day. It was really fun to see the look on peoples faces, the happiness inside when they got food for their families.</p>

                <p>Monticello High School offers Homework Club after school for students who need access to computers or tutors for help. I have really enjoyed the time I have been able to volunteer my time as a tutor after school. One skill that come in particularly handy was my ability to help students with computer related homework.</p>
