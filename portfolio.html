			  <h3>2D Graphics | Photoshop & Illustrator</h3>
			  <p>Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop are amazing tools for creating beautiful graphics.</p>

					<h3>Photoshop Project</h3>
					<p>Photoshop is a great tool to use to edit and manipulate pictures. The first picture I did was a project for my Digital Media class. The objective was to take an image of one of our faculty members and create a polygonal effect. It took a lot of time to make this project, because it required making over 300 polygons.</p>
					<p>For the second picture, I was assigned to create a text effect that manipulated the background image for contrast in the background of the text.</p>
					<p>The third image is definitely one of my favorites. We were learning how to use complex brushes in Photoshop and were required to create a painting using those brushes.
</p>

						<h3>Illustrator Project</h3>
							<p>These are some of the few Ilustrator projects that I have done. When I first started learning about Illustrator I created my superheros. They were really fun to make, which is why I have a lot of them. The storefront was a graphic that I made as part of my Graphic Design event in FBLA last year. </p>
							<p>One of my favorite things was creating the painting of a locally inspired landscape using Illustrator. This was different from the landscape painting I did in Photoshop because the tools in Illustrator are a little different. Christmas is one of my most favorite times of the year, so I had to create a Christmas card design and nothing says christmas without some snow and a happy snow family! </p>

			  <h3>3D Graphics | Autodesk Maya & Mudbox</h3>
			   <p>Mudbox and Maya are 3D software. Mudbox is generally for digital painting and sculpting. Maya is used for creating environments, scenes, and virtual reality.</p>

					<h3>Mudbox Project</h3>
					<p>Mudbox is fun to use because you get to sculpt using digital clay. I was able to create a landscape as well as a dinosaur. I used different types of clay, different sculpting methods, and painting style to create the landscape. For the dinosaur I focused on adding detail to make him more realistic looking. </p>

					<h3>Maya Project</h3>
					<p>The room that I created took a lot of time. There are a lot of small intricate details that go into creating something like this. However, despite the complexity of the program, I enjoyed learning it.</p>

			  <h3>Video & Animation</h3>
			  <p>Adobe After Effects is motion graphic and visual effect software, mainly used for titles, shapes, special effects and so on. Adobe Premiere is used for editing videos and combining multiple media along with it. Adobe Animate is for creating animations frame by frame.</p>

					<h3>Premiere Project</h3>
					<p>For this project we used Adobe Premiere to create a slideshow video of still images. We were given the choice of topic and I chose to incorporate images of my siblings. The song is called "Sad Song" by We the Kings.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
						<p>This is the first animation that I had done. I was surprised of how much work went into the tiny video. There are so many frames that need to be created to even make the character take a single step. It took drawing the same character over and over in slightly different positions.</p>

				<h4>UFO Project</h4>
				<p>For this project we were required to add a separate UFO video to an image, then use special effects to make it look like someone was actually filming with the UFO appearing and zooming through the sky. We also needed to make it look realistic, so we had to add some audio and camera shake to the project.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
					<p>I am fascinated by the song ‘Sound of Silence’ redone by Disturbed. So, when we were assigned to do a lyric video I had to do this song. I liked using Adobe After Effects because it was easy for me to create the lyrics and using effects like moving the text across the screen, or making it disappear.</p>

						<p>For this project we were required to replicate a drawn image from a piece of paper using strictly JavaScrip programming. We also had the additional challenge of animating the chinese flying star. </p>
