	                <p>Throughout my high school career, I have earned many certifications that relate to computer technology. For each computer class I have taken in high school I have earned the CTE State Skills Certificate. This certifications demonstrate that I have learned the skills and knowledge at the required proficiency level mandatated by the state.</p>
			<p>In addition to taking the state tests for the courses I have taken, I have also had the opportunity to take some industry level certifications. I have successfully passed the Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop exams in the last two years. I also recently passed the Microsoft Technoloy Associate exam for the Introduction to Programming using HTML and CSS. All of these certifications are a testament to my knowledge and skills earned in the courses I have taken.</p>

                <h3>FBLA Awards</h3>
                	 	<p>As part of our local FBLA chapter I have had the opportunity to serve as a chapter officer as well as compete in various events. This year I chose the event, Publication Design. For this event I was required to create promotion material for a fresh food home delivery business as well as come up with a business name. I chose to create a logo, advertisement poster, business card, holiday flyers, and a meal recipe card using various Adobe programs. This event could be comprised of an individual or up to a team of three people. I chose to do it by myself, even though I knew how much work it would be and knowing that I would have to present it by myself as well.</p> 
		    	<p>This activity is important and meaningful to me because of the amount of work I put into it as well as the way it helped me to grow. When I presented it at the regional competition in December of this school year, I was really nervous. In fact, I have always struggled with presenting in front of people and I often experience severe anxiety. Despite my nervousness, I was able to successfully present this project to the three judges and I achieved an average score of 97/100 pts. This earned me 2nd place. This was a great moment for me because it helped me to see my potential and I realized I am able to develop the skills to present in front of others. Of course this meant I was better prepared and way more excited to present this again at the state competition because I had practiced multiple times, had beautiful visual aids, and to my surprise I wasnâ€™t as nervous. At the state competition I ended up making it into the finals with the preliminary presentation, and by the time I made it to the final round I had really overcome most of my anxiety and nervousness. The result was that I placed 7th in my event, but more importantly I have walked away from this experience with the knowledge, confidence and skills to be more successful in future projects and experiences like these. I also realized that I can participate in activities like these on my own, which is huge because it has always been really hard for me to stand up by myself. Ultimately, I learned that people need to be willing to transcend their comfort zones to increase their potential and abilities.</p>
